## Insights Summary  
#### In order to evaluate business performance, we focused on the following key metrics:  

- **Total Sales**: Overall revenue generated from all product categories ($1.55M).  
- **Profit (Baseline)**: Net earnings before shipping costs ($427K).  
- **Profit Margin**: Profit as a percentage of sales (27.5%).  
- **Shipping Costs**: Total logistics expense incurred ($385K baseline).  
- **Category Profitability %**: Contribution margin by category (e.g., Electronics 44.3%, Grooming 35.3%, Pet Food 20.6%).  
- **Top-Selling Products**: High-volume items driving revenue, such as *Taste of the Wild Dog Food*, *Dog & Puppy Pads*, and *Memory Foam Pet Beds*.  
- **Average Quantity per Order**: Number of units shipped per category (e.g., Pet Food 5.31, Cleaning Supplies 4.56, Electronics 1.38).  
- **Market Basket Combinations**: Products most frequently purchased together (e.g., Dog Pads + Poop Bags, Dog Food + Beds).  
- **Shipping Savings Potential**: Difference between baseline and optimized shipping ($59K).  
- **Regional Shipping Costs**: Distribution of shipping expenses by geographic region (East, Central, West).  
#### Sales Performance  
- Total sales reached **$1.55M**, with a profit baseline of **$427K**.  
- The overall **profit margin of 27.5%** is healthy but constrained by high logistics costs.  
- Shipping costs of **$385K** are nearly equivalent to profit, putting pressure on net profitability.  

#### Category Profitability  
- **Electronics (44.3%)** and **Grooming (35.3%)** delivered the strongest profit margins, making them key drivers of profitability.  
- **Pet Food (20.6%)** and **Food (22.7%)** had the weakest margins, but they accounted for high sales volume, functioning as customer acquisition products.  
- Disposables and Cleaning Supplies had moderate profitability (~27‚Äì28%), supported by recurring purchases.  

#### Product Performance  
- *Taste of the Wild High Prairie Dog Food* was the top revenue driver, though at relatively lower margins.  
- *Dog & Puppy Pads* and *Memory Foam Pet Beds* showed strong recurring demand, indicating customer reliance on these essentials.  
- High-margin but lower-sales products (e.g., Grooming Tools, Pet Cameras) provide upsell opportunities when bundled with consumables.  

#### Market Basket & Cross-Sell Behavior  
- *Dog & Puppy Pads* were most frequently purchased with *Poop Bags*, forming a strong ‚Äúclean-up‚Äù combination.  
- *Taste of the Wild Dog Food* acted as a **basket magnet**, often paired with *Memory Foam Pet Beds*.  
- Accessories like Grooming Brushes and Pet Odor Eliminators were frequently added to consumable purchases.  
- Customers show routine replenishment behavior (pads, food, supplements), highlighting a strong case for subscription models.  

#### Shipping Metrics  
- Baseline shipping costs: **$385K**; Optimized ‚ÄúWhat-if‚Äù scenario: **$326K**, revealing a **$59K savings potential (~15%)**.  
- Highest shipping cost drivers were **Dog Food, Pet Beds, Pads, Poop Bags, and Cat Litter** due to size and frequency.  
- Average quantities shipped per order were highest for **Pet Food (5.31)** and **Cleaning Supplies (4.56)**, suggesting bulk buying behavior.  
- Electronics averaged only **1.38 units per order**, aligning better with bundling promotions.  
- Regional costs were highest in **East and Central U.S.**, while **West Coast orders** faced higher per-unit shipping costs due to distance.  
## Recommendations  
- **Shipping Optimization**: Reduce costs by consolidating bulky shipments (Dog Food, Beds, Pads) and incentivizing larger order sizes with free shipping thresholds. Explore carrier negotiations and regional fulfillment (especially West Coast) to capture the $59K potential savings (~15%).  

- **High-Margin Categories**: Reallocate promotional focus from low-margin Food to high-margin categories like **Electronics (44.3%)** and **Grooming (35.3%)**. These should be featured prominently in cross-sells, loyalty rewards, and premium upsells.  

- **Subscriptions**: Launch auto-ship programs for **recurring consumables** (Pet Food, Pads, Supplements). This leverages customer replenishment behavior, improves retention, and stabilizes recurring revenue.  

- **Cross-Sell Promotions**: At checkout, recommend **Memory Foam Pet Beds** when customers purchase *Taste of the Wild Dog Food* (the most common bundle). Bundle Pads + Poop Bags as a ‚ÄúClean-Up Pack,‚Äù and Food + Supplements as a ‚ÄúWellness Pack.‚Äù  

- **Regional Strategy**: Tailor offers by geography‚Äîencourage bulk purchasing in **high shipping cost regions** (West Coast) through targeted promotions, while optimizing Central/East for shipping efficiency.  

- **Product Bundling Strategy**: Combine **high-volume, low-margin consumables** with **low-volume, high-margin accessories** (e.g., Food + Grooming Brush, Pads + Pet Camera). This increases cart value without significant shipping cost increases.
